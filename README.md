# GWC Summer Immersion Project Game Jam - Sparks of Hope

## Synopsis

You are stuck in a monochrome building, where all hope of escape appears to be lost. You wander between three rooms: the kitchen, hallway, and bedroom. Bored, you begin to fidget with the items laying around. Suddenly, you find a game to play. It brings you so much joy...so much so that you feel as though if you played enough games, you'd have enough sparks of hope to escape this dreary place...

This is an escape room game created under the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program for a project called Game Jam. Created using javascript and replit, I utilized the built-in physics engine for the minigames and finished within three days.
